My classes in computer science are challenging but rewarding. I've joined a coding club and a book club, which has introduced me to many interesting people.</p>
                <p>One of the biggest lessons I've learned is the importance of time management. Juggling coursework, projects, and a social life requires careful planning. I use a digital planner to keep track of deadlines and schedule my free time. It's not always easy, but the effort is worth it.</p>
                <p>I also want to highlight the support system I've found here. My professors are incredibly helpful, and my friends are always there to cheer me on. University isn't just about grades; it's about the connections you make and the person you become. I'm looking forward to the rest of my time here and am optimistic about the future.</p>`

                    <li><strong>Lok Lak (Shaking Beef):</strong> This is a classic! Tender pieces of marinated beef stir-fried with onions and served with a side of fresh lettuce, tomatoes, and a pepper-lime dipping sauce. It's simple but full of flavor.</li>
                    <li><strong>Amok:</strong> A must-try! Amok is a creamy, curried fish dish steamed in a banana leaf cup. The texture is custardy, and the flavor is a delicate balance of lemongrass, galangal, and coconut milk.</li>
                    <li><strong>Kuy Teav (Noodle Soup):</strong> The perfect comfort food. A clear, flavorful pork or beef broth with rice noodles, topped with thinly sliced meat, fresh herbs, and a sprinkle of fried garlic. It's a staple for breakfast.</li>
